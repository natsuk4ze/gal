# Contribution Recommendations

Welcome to the Gal contribution guide💚 Feel free to create issue or PR.
- ## Style
  We recommend following [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/effective-dart).
  
- ## Question
  We recommend that you use the [Discussions](https://github.com/natsuk4ze/gal/discussions).
  
- ## Proposed new features or report a bug
  We recommend that you use the [Issue](https://github.com/natsuk4ze/gal/issues)
  with template for each.
  > If you suddenly submit a new feature or breaking change in a pull request, 
    it will take longer to review and time will be wasted if it is rejected😢
